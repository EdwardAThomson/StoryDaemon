## Story Summary

### Premise
A cyberpunk thriller about **Prisoss Jornern**, a hacker/data thief in a dystopian arcology controlled by the megacorporation **OmniCorp**. She steals a classified file called **ICARUS** and becomes the target of a relentless corporate manhunt.

### Act 1: The Heist Gone Wrong
- Prisoss infiltrates a secure network and downloads the ICARUS file, but triggers a **watcher process** that marks her as a target
- She executes a "burn protocol"—destroying her hideout and equipment—but keeps the data on a ghost chip
- OmniCorp deploys **Stalker teams** and an entity called **The Observer** to hunt her
- She escapes into the **undercity**, a lawless maze of abandoned tunnels beneath the arcology

### Act 2: The Descent
- Aided by black-market contacts like **Verayn Cyris** (tech broker) and **Galix Starkard** (paranoid information broker), Prisoss flees deeper underground
- She follows rumors of "**The Glimmer**"—a mythical sanctuary or power source hidden in the depths
- OmniCorp escalates, deploying **Deep Salvage** teams to literally dig her out
- Galix, watching from his hidden node, breaks his rule of isolation to send her a coded warning

### Act 3: The Core
- Prisoss discovers an ancient, alien **crystalline entity** called **The Core**—a god-like intelligence imprisoned deep in the mountain
- The Core detects a "ghost protocol" (tracking device) on her wrist-light and gives her an ultimatum: remove it or be "sterilized"
- Before she can choose, OmniCorp's drill breaches the sanctuary, triggering catastrophic destruction
- In the chaos, **Prisoss fuses with a crystal shard**, transforming her: her eyes turn molten gold, light pulses through her veins, and she becomes "the seed" of the dying Core

### Act 4: Transformation and Capture
- Prisoss survives the mountain's collapse inside a **cocoon of solid light** generated by the crystal fused to her hand
- She learns to control this energy cocoon, using it to move through solid rock
- **The Hounds**—sleek, obsidian predators with physics-defying abilities—hunt her down
- She's captured and delivered to a **colossal alien mothership** as an "offering"
- Meanwhile, **Director Kaelen** designates her energy source "**Priority Prime**" and orders **Sylyn Vexes** to retrieve it "by any means necessary"—even if it means killing Prisoss

### Current State (End of 72 scenes, ~56,000 words)
- Prisoss is alone in a vast, sterile containment bay inside the alien vessel, waiting for "the collector"
- Galix has shifted from passive observer to active ally, trying to warn her
- OmniCorp is mobilizing to board the alien ship
- Multiple factions are converging on Prisoss and the power she now carries

### Themes
- **Corporate dehumanization** ("disposable container")
- **Transformation and identity** (human becoming something other)
- **Isolation vs. connection** (Galix's choice to break his solitude)
- **Ancient power vs. modern technology**

The story has strong emergent continuity—characters like Galix, Verayn, and the Hounds were introduced organically and recur meaningfully. The open loops (Who is the collector? What is the Hounds' origin? Can Galix reach her?) set up future developments.
