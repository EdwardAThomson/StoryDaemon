# StoryDaemon

**Agentic Novel Generation System with Emergent Narrative**

StoryDaemon is a Python-based system that generates long-form fiction through an autonomous agent that plans, writes, and evolves stories organically. Unlike traditional story generators, StoryDaemon emphasizes emergence over pre-planning, allowing narrative structure to develop naturally through iterative "story ticks."

## Features

- 🤖 **Agentic Architecture** - LLM-driven agent makes autonomous decisions using structured tools
- 📖 **Deep POV Writing** - Strict point-of-view discipline for immersive narrative
- 🧠 **Evolving Memory** - Characters, locations, and story elements dynamically update
- 🎯 **Emergent Structure** - No pre-outlining; story develops organically
- 💰 **Zero Additional Cost** - Uses Codex CLI for GPT-5 access (included in subscription)
- 🔧 **Tool-Based System** - Extensible tool registry for character generation, memory search, etc.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Codex CLI installed and authenticated
  ```bash
  npm install -g @openai/codex-cli
  codex auth
  ```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/EdwardAThomson/StoryDaemon.git
cd StoryDaemon

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Or install with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Create Your First Novel

```bash
# Create a new novel project
novel new my-story

# Navigate to the project
cd ~/novels/my-story

# Generate your first scene
novel tick

# Check project status
novel status

# Generate multiple scenes
novel run --n 5
```

## How It Works

StoryDaemon uses a **story tick loop** where each tick produces one scene passage:

1. **Summarize State** - Collect context from previous passages and memory
2. **Plan** - Planner LLM decides which tools to use, scene intention, and optional length guidance
3. **Execute Tools** - Run character generation, memory search, etc.
4. **Write** - Writer LLM generates prose in deep POV (flexible length based on scene needs)
5. **Evaluate** - Check continuity and POV integrity
6. **Commit** - Save scene and update memory

### Memory System

Each novel maintains its own working directory with:

- **Characters** - Dynamic character data with goals, relationships, emotional state
- **Locations** - Evolving location descriptions with sensory details
- **Scenes** - Scene metadata and summaries
- **Open Loops** - Unresolved narrative threads
- **Vector Index** - Semantic search for context retrieval

## CLI Commands

```bash
# Create new novel project
novel new <name> [--dir <path>]

# Generate one scene
novel tick [--project <path>]

# Generate multiple scenes
novel run --n <count> [--project <path>]

# Show project status
novel status [--project <path>]

# Compile scene summaries
novel summarize [--project <path>]
```

## Configuration

Global configuration in `~/.storydaemon/config.yaml`:

```yaml
llm:
  codex_bin_path: codex
  planner_max_tokens: 1000
  writer_max_tokens: 3000

paths:
  novels_dir: ~/novels

generation:
  max_tools_per_tick: 3
  recent_scenes_count: 3           # Context for planner
  include_overall_summary: true    # Include story-wide summary
  # Scene length is flexible - planner can optionally suggest "brief", "short", "long", or "extended"
```

Project-specific configuration in `<project>/config.yaml`.

- **Deep POV realism** - Narrative written through character perception
- **Memory evolution** - Entities grow and change organically
- **Tool autonomy** - LLM decides which tools to use based on story needs
